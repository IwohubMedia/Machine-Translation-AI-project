Machine Translation AI Project
=============================

Overview
This project is focused on developing a machine translation model that can translate text from one language to another using deep learning techniques. It is designed as an open-source learning resource for students, developers, and researchers who are interested in natural language processing and machine translation.

Objectives
- Build a simple yet effective translation model.
- Train and test the model on bilingual datasets.
- Provide an easy-to-follow structure for experimentation and improvement.

Project Structure
- data/ : Contains training and testing datasets.
- models/ : Contains model architectures and trained weights.
- notebooks/ : Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
- scripts/ : Utility scripts for model training and testing.
- results/ : Saved evaluation metrics and translation outputs.

Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- PyTorch
- TensorFlow (optional, if using alternative models)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   git clone https://github.com/IwohubMedia/Machine-Translation-AI-project.git
2. Navigate into the project folder:
